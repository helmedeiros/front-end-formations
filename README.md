#### THE NEW DOCTYPE
In HTML4 we have 3 different types of Doctypes, that simple putting are only copy and pasted from one project to the other. They are:

1. HTML 4.01 Strict: `<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">`
2. HTML 4.01 Transitional: `<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">`
3. HTML 4.01 Frameset: `<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/frameset.dtd">`
