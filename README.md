Code School - Learn the latest versions of HTML &amp; CSS. Take a look at new HTML5 tags, form elements, attributes, input types, border-radius, box-shadow, gradients, and more.

### LEVEL 1 - Overview & Updates
Get an overview of HTML5 and CSS3, and learn which HTML elements have been updated in HTML5. 

#### THE NEW DOCTYPE
In HTML4 we have 3 different types of Doctypes, that simple putting are only copy and pasted from one project to the other. They are:

1. Strict: `<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">`
2. Transitional: `<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">`
3. Frameset: `<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/frameset.dtd">`

Now in the HTML5, we only need a simple one: `<!DOCTYPE html>`

##### Challenge
Start out by writing the new HTML5 doctype into the index.html inside level_1/1


#### THE META DECLARATION
The meta declaration is another updated tag, in the HTML4 it has two attribute uncessary in the HTML5 and looked like: `<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">`. 

Now in the HTML5, a new attribute was added, and the meta for encode definition looks like: `<meta charset="UTF-8">`

##### Challenge
Write the new HTML5 `meta` declaration for specifying the character encoding of our document. It should use `UTF-8` as the encoding. Use the level_1/2/index.html

#### THE SCRIPT TAG
The script tag used normally for javascript inclusion, was updated. In the HTML4 we specify the `type` attribute as `text/javascript` like `<script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>`. 

Now in the HTML5 they changed browsers so they can infer javascript as type, so the new script tag for HTML5 is: `<script src="file.js"></script>`.

##### Challenge
Assuming that we have the HTML inside level_1/3/index.html script tag in HTML4, remove the portion we do not need in HTML5.
